Ory Network currently enforces three rate limit policies based on the path of your request.

1. `/sessions/whoami`: A dedicated rate limit policy for all calls to the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint to keep these separate from
   all other calls.
2. `/identities`: A dedicated rate limit policiy for all calls to the `/identities` endpoint to throttle the number of requests to
   this endpoint.
3. `*`: All other calls a managed by this rate limit policy.

Each policy defines two rate limits:

1. `burst`: a per second rate limit of requests to allow for some requests spikes for a short period of time
2. `sustained`: a rate limit of requests for a 1 minute time window

The following table shows the limits of the three rate-limit policies for each subscription plan tier:

| Subscription Plan | Path / Bucket                              | Rate Limits (burst/sustained)                                    |
